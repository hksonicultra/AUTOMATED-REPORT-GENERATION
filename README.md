# üìä Sales Report Generator

## üìå Overview

This project is a **Python script** that reads sales data from a CSV file, analyzes it, and generates a **PDF report** with:

* **Total Sales**
* **Average Sales**
* **Maximum Sale Value**
* **Detailed Product Sales Table**

It uses the **FPDF** library for creating the PDF file in a clean, tabular format.

## üóÇ Project Structure

```
.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ generate_report.py   # Main Python script
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ sales_data.csv       # Input sales data file (CSV format)

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **Read CSV File**

   * Reads product name, units sold, and price per unit from `sales_data.csv`.

2. **Analyze Data**

   * Calculates:

     * **Total Sales** (units √ó price, summed across all products)
     * **Average Sales** per product
     * **Maximum Sale Value**

3. **Generate PDF Report**

   * Creates a **Sales Report** with:

     * Summary statistics (Total, Average, Max)
     * A detailed table of product sales
